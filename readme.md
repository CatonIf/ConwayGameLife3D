# Conway's Game of Life 3D
This is the Conway's Game of Life but in 3D. It's all in Java, to work with the Processing 3 engine.

The rules (wich can be easily changed) are:
- a dead cell with 7 neighbours becomes live
- a live cell with more or 7 neighbours becomes dead
- a live cell with 1 neighbour becomes dead

The neighbours of a cell are the 26 cells around it wich share at least one vertex with it.
